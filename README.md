Tiny app to add several actions to volume buttons.

Actions:
- Volume Up   long - next track
- Volume Down long - previous track

Does NOT work when the screen is fully off. For the better user experience use 
[Key Mapper](https://github.com/sds100/KeyMapper).

## Permissions

`ACCESSIBILITY` get volume key events

`VIBRATE` notify on action success
